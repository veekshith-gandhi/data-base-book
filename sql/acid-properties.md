# âœ… ACID Properties â€“ The 4 Golden Rules for Reliable Transactions in Databases

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s a Database Transaction?

A **transaction** is a group of operations in a database that must all succeed or all fail. For example:
> Transferring â‚¹1000 from your account to a friend:
> - Deduct â‚¹1000 from your account
> - Add â‚¹1000 to your friendâ€™s account

If any step fails, the entire transaction should be cancelled â€” that's where **ACID** comes in.

## ðŸ§± ACID Properties Explained

### ðŸ”´ 1. A â€“ **Atomicity**: All or Nothing

- **Definition**: All operations in a transaction must succeed. If one fails, everything is rolled back.
- **Problem Without It**: â‚¹1000 deducted but not added to friendâ€™s account â€” money disappears.
- **Fix**: Database rolls back the transaction if any step fails.

---

### ðŸ”´ 2. C â€“ **Consistency**: Data Must Be Valid

- **Definition**: Transactions should move the database from one valid state to another.
- **Problem Without It**: Sending â‚¹1000 when you have â‚¹500 could leave you with -â‚¹500 (invalid state).
- **Fix**: Database applies rules (like minimum balance) to prevent invalid data.

### ðŸ”´ 3. I â€“ **Isolation**: Transactions Donâ€™t Interfere

- **Definition**: Multiple transactions running at the same time should not affect each other.
- **Problem Without It**: Two users book the same last train ticket.
- **Fix**: Database uses locks and schedules to isolate transactions.

### ðŸ”´ 4. D â€“ **Durability**: Once Saved, Always Saved

- **Definition**: After a transaction is committed, it remains saved even if the system crashes.
- **Problem Without It**: You pay for something, system crashes, and it forgets the payment.
- **Fix**: Database writes changes to permanent memory or logs.

| Step | ACID Rule     | What Happens                                         | What it Protects              |
|------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | Atomicity     | Deduct â‚¹1000 from you, add to friend, or cancel all | Prevents half-transfers       |
| 2    | Consistency   | Validates rules like balance not going negative     | Keeps data correct            |
| 3    | Isolation     | Handles 10 people transferring at once independently| Prevents data clashes         |
| 4    | Durability    | Saves permanently even after crash                  | Ensures nothing is lost       |

## ðŸ§© Summary Table

| ACID Rule     | Problem Without It            | Fix / How Databases Handle It      |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Atomicity     | Half transactions, lost money | Use rollback if something fails    |
| Consistency   | Invalid data (e.g. -â‚¹500)     | Apply rules, constraints, checks   |
| Isolation     | Data clash, overbooking       | Use locks, queues, isolation levels |
| Durability    | Data loss after crash         | Save to permanent logs/memory      |
